### The Importance of Governance and Controlled Environments in Power BI and Fabric

Governance and a locked-down environment in Power BI and Microsoft Fabric are essential to ensure efficient resource utilisation and maintain control over the platform. Without governance, users can create unregulated workspaces, datasets, and reports, leading to resource sprawl, overuse of capacities, and increased costs. Poorly managed environments can result in redundant or unnecessary artefacts consuming valuable compute and storage resources. Implementing governance policies and restricting access ensures that only authorised personnel can create or manage resources, optimising capacity usage, improving performance, and aligning the platform with organisational compliance and operational goals.
