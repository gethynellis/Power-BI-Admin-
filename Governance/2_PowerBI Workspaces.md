# **Implementing Microsoft Fabric with Governance in a Power BI Environment**

### Introduction
Your organisation has an existing Power BI implementation that lacks structure, resulting in numerous uncontrolled workspaces. Transitioning to Microsoft Fabric offers an excellent opportunity to establish a governed data platform that ensures operational efficiency and compliance while enabling collaboration. This document outlines a strategic plan to:

1. Understand the current state of Power BI workspaces.
2. Identify orphaned workspaces.
3. Define a governance policy.
4. Implement controlled permissions in Microsoft Fabric.

### Step 1: Understanding Existing Workspaces

#### Actions:
1. **Workspace Inventory:**
   - Use the Power BI Admin Portal or REST APIs to extract a list of all workspaces, including details like workspace name, owner, creation date, and last modified date.
   - Tools like PowerShell or custom scripts can automate this extraction.

2. **Analyse Workspace Metadata:**
   - Review activity logs to identify usage patterns and understand which workspaces are actively used.

#### Output:
- A detailed inventory of all workspaces.
- Categorisation into active, inactive, and rarely used workspaces.

### Step 2: Identifying Orphaned Workspaces

#### Actions:
1. **Ownership Audit:**
   - Identify workspaces without an assigned owner or where the owner’s account is inactive (e.g., if they have left the organisation).
   - Use Power BI Admin APIs or Azure Active Directory (AAD) to cross-reference user activity and account status.

2. **Assign Temporary Owners:**
   - Assign temporary administrative ownership to orphaned workspaces for evaluation.

3. **Engage Stakeholders:**
   - Reach out to department heads or key users to verify whether orphaned workspaces are still needed.

#### Output:
- A list of orphaned workspaces with action plans (e.g., archive, delete, or reassign).

### Step 3: Writing a Governance Policy

#### Objectives:
- Ensure clear ownership and accountability.
- Prevent sprawl and redundancy.
- Define standards for workspace usage, naming conventions, and permissions.

#### Key Components of the Policy:
1. **Workspace Governance:**
   - Mandatory assignment of owners to all workspaces.
   - Define a lifecycle management policy (e.g., review workspace usage every six months).
   - Standardised naming conventions (e.g., Department-Project).

2. **Content Standards:**
   - Define acceptable data sources and Power BI artefacts.
   - Enforce metadata tagging for datasets and reports.

3. **Access Management:**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) using AAD groups.
   - Define who can create, manage, and access workspaces.

4. **Compliance:**
   - Document audit processes and reporting mechanisms to ensure adherence to the governance policy.
   - Maintain logs for compliance purposes.

5. **Training and Awareness:**
   - Conduct regular training for workspace owners and users.
   - Publish a user guide for governance standards.

### Step 4: Understanding Permissions in Microsoft Fabric

#### Overview of Permissions in Fabric:
Microsoft Fabric offers integrated governance tools such as AAD and Microsoft Purview. Key permission models include:

1. **Workspace Permissions:**
   - Admin, Member, Contributor, and Viewer roles dictate access and editing rights.
   - Use AAD groups to manage access efficiently.

2. **Capability Controls:**
   - Define who can create datasets, pipelines, and lakehouses through tenant settings.

3. **Data Security:**
   - Implement row-level security (RLS) for datasets.
   - Use sensitivity labels to classify and protect data.

4. **Microsoft Purview Integration:**
   - Utilise Purview for data lineage, discovery, and classification.

#### Actions:
1. **Centralised Access Management:**
   - Configure tenant-wide settings in the Power BI Admin Portal to restrict the creation of certain artefacts.
   - Use Fabric’s security roles to delegate permissions appropriately.

2. **Auditing and Monitoring:**
   - Enable activity logs to monitor who creates or modifies artefacts.
   - Use monitoring tools to ensure compliance with governance policies.

#### Output:
- A clearly defined permission matrix for Microsoft Fabric.
- Implementation of security and compliance measures aligned with organisational needs.

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Assessment
- Complete the inventory of workspaces.
- Identify and address orphaned workspaces.

#### Phase 2: Governance Framework
- Develop and publish the governance policy.
- Communicate the policy to stakeholders.

#### Phase 3: Microsoft Fabric Rollout
- Configure tenant settings and permissions.
- Train users and admins on governance and security standards.

#### Phase 4: Ongoing Monitoring
- Implement regular audits.
- Provide periodic updates to the governance policy based on organisational needs and Fabric updates.

### Conclusion
Implementing Microsoft Fabric with a governance-first approach ensures a well-structured and secure data platform. By understanding the current workspace landscape, addressing orphaned workspaces, and defining a clear governance framework, your organisation can achieve an optimised and scalable solution.
