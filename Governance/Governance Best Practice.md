# Best Practices for Microsoft Fabric Governance

Microsoft Fabric is a powerful unified data platform that enables organisations to efficiently manage and analyse their data. As a local authority in the UK, adopting Microsoft Fabric can offer significant benefits, but it also necessitates a well-thought-out governance strategy. This document outlines best practices to ensure controlled, secure, and compliant usage of Microsoft Fabric, with particular emphasis on workspace creation, permissions management, and data protection.

## 1. Workspace Creation

Workspaces are the foundation for organising and managing content in Microsoft Fabric. Establishing a controlled and structured approach to workspace creation is essential for maintaining order and minimising governance risks.

### Best Practices:

- **Controlled Workspace Creation:**
  - Limit the ability to create workspaces to a specific group of users, such as IT administrators or data governance officers. This ensures only authorised personnel can create workspaces, reducing the risk of sprawl.
  - Utilise the Fabric Admin Portal to configure workspace creation permissions by restricting workspace creation rights to approved Azure Active Directory (AAD) security groups.

- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Develop and enforce standardised naming conventions for workspaces to make them easily identifiable and organised (e.g., `Dept-Project-Purpose`).
  - Include metadata in the name where appropriate, such as department codes or project identifiers.

- **Templates and Tags:**
  - Create and use workspace templates that predefine settings, including permissions, linked datasets, and data classification levels.
  - Use tags to categorise workspaces by purpose, owner, or sensitivity level, simplifying management and reporting.

## 2. Permissions Management

Permissions in Microsoft Fabric determine who can access, edit, or manage workspaces and their contents. Establishing a robust permissions model is key to ensuring data security and operational efficiency.

### Best Practices:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Implement RBAC using predefined roles such as Admin, Member, and Viewer. Align roles with user responsibilities to minimise over-permissioning.
  - Avoid using individual user accounts in permissions; instead, leverage AAD groups to manage access collectively.

- **Permission Reviews:**
  - Conduct regular audits of workspace permissions to ensure compliance with access policies.
  - Automate permissions reviews where possible using governance tools and PowerShell scripts.

- **Principle of Least Privilege:**
  - Grant users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
  - Monitor access logs for any indications of excessive permissions or unauthorised access attempts.

- **External Sharing Controls:**
  - Disable external sharing by default to prevent data leakage.
  - Require approval processes for enabling external access to specific datasets or reports.

## 3. Data Protection and Classification

Data protection is a critical aspect of Microsoft Fabric governance, especially for local authorities handling sensitive and personal data. Establishing a framework for data classification and protection helps ensure compliance with UK regulations like GDPR and local authority standards.

### Best Practices:

- **Data Classification:**
  - Define a data classification policy that categorises data into levels such as Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted.
  - Use Microsoft Purview to apply sensitivity labels to datasets and enforce access controls accordingly.

- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):**
  - Enable DLP policies within Microsoft Purview to detect and block sensitive data sharing based on predefined rules.
  - Regularly update DLP policies to align with changes in organisational and regulatory requirements.

- **Encryption:**
  - Ensure all data stored within Microsoft Fabric is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
  - Leverage Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) options for encryption if additional control is required.

- **Monitoring and Alerts:**
  - Implement monitoring solutions to track data access and usage patterns.
  - Configure alerts for anomalous activities, such as unauthorised access attempts or data exfiltration.

## 4. Governance Policies and Processes

A strong governance framework relies on clear policies and consistent enforcement. Defining and documenting governance processes ensures alignment across teams and stakeholders.

### Best Practices:

- **Policy Definition:**
  - Develop a governance policy document that outlines roles, responsibilities, and workflows for managing Microsoft Fabric.
  - Include policies for workspace creation, permissions management, and data lifecycle management.

- **Automation:**
  - Automate governance tasks using tools such as Azure Logic Apps or Microsoft Power Automate to reduce manual effort and increase consistency.

- **Stakeholder Engagement:**
  - Form a governance committee that includes representatives from IT, data teams, and business units.
  - Regularly review and update governance practices based on feedback and organisational needs.

## 5. Compliance with UK Regulations

As a local authority, compliance with UK regulations such as GDPR is non-negotiable. Microsoft Fabric provides tools to facilitate compliance, but governance processes must support these efforts.

### Best Practices:

- **GDPR Readiness:**
  - Use Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager to assess and manage GDPR compliance.
  - Maintain a record of processing activities for datasets stored in Microsoft Fabric.

- **Retention Policies:**
  - Define data retention policies that align with legal and organisational requirements.
  - Use Fabricâ€™s data lifecycle management features to automate retention and deletion processes.

- **Audit Trails:**
  - Enable and review audit logs to ensure accountability and traceability of user actions.
  - Use Microsoft Sentinel for advanced security monitoring and threat detection.

## Conclusion

Adopting Microsoft Fabric and F64 capacity is an exciting step forward for your local authority, offering significant opportunities to improve data management and analysis. However, successful implementation requires a robust governance framework to ensure security, compliance, and operational efficiency. By following these best practices for workspace creation, permissions management, data protection, and compliance, your organisation can fully leverage Microsoft Fabric while maintaining control and protecting sensitive information.
