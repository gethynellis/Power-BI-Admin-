   - Explain that the goal is to identify **real-world applications** of Power BI relevant to your workplace.

2. **Group Discussion (40 minutes)**  
   - Break into groups of 3–5 people.
   - Discuss the following questions to help generate ideas:
     - **Data sources**: What data do you currently have access to at work? (e.g., spreadsheets, databases, cloud tools).
     - **Business needs**: What problems or inefficiencies could data visualisation or reporting solve in your organisation?
     - **Key metrics**: What metrics or KPIs would be helpful to track in real-time?
     - **Stakeholders**: Who would benefit most from having access to the insights you generate in Power BI?
   - Use a whiteboard, sticky notes, or shared documents to capture your group’s ideas.
   - Narrow your list to one idea that:
     - Solves a specific business problem.
     - Has measurable impact.
     - Could be implemented in your organisation.

3. **Prepare Your Presentation (10 minutes)**  
   - Each group should summarise their chosen idea to present to the class.
   - Include:
     - **The problem or opportunity** your idea addresses.
     - **The data** you would use.
     - **The Power BI solution** (e.g., dashboard, report, automated alerts).
     - **The impact** on your organisation or team.

4. **Group Presentations (5 minutes per group)**  
   - One representative from each group will present the idea back to the class.
   - Presentations should be short and focused—around 3–5 minutes.
